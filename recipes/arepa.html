        <p><strong>Description:</strong> A traditional Venezuelan staple, you can fill it with anything.</p>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of pre-cooked white cornmeal (Harina PAN)</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups of warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of oil (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Equipment:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Frying pan or griddle</li>
            <li>Spatula</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Instructions:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of pre-cooked white cornmeal and 1 teaspoon of salt. Gradually add 2 ½ cups of warm water, mixing with your hands until a smooth dough forms. Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes to hydrate fully.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape the Arepas:</strong> Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it into a disc about ½ inch thick.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Arepas:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan or griddle over medium heat. Place the arepas in the pan, ensuring they are not overcrowded. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, until a golden crust forms. They should sound hollow when tapped.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish in the Oven (Optional):</strong> For a fluffier interior, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). After frying, transfer the arepas to a baking sheet and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Let the arepas cool slightly, then slice them open like a pita pocket. Fill with your favorite ingredients such as cheese, ham, chicken, avocado, or beans.</li>
        </ol>
